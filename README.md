## Usage:

## Concept:

When visiting a website, the browser typically requests data and pages from the main server, often including advertisement URLs from providers. Even though users don't specifically request this additional data, the browser fetches it by default. This extension aims to prevent such requested data from specific providers by name. A predefined list of known advertisement providers is included, and users have the option to add more to enhance efficiency.
